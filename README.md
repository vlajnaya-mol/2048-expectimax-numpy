# 2048-expectimax-numpy
My implementation of 2048 game using pygame with expectimax based AI.  
Code contains shortest (~10 lines) numpy implementation of 2048-game move (sliding and merging cells)

Needs following improvements:
TODO not only square boards
TODO fix colors
TODO undo score decreasing
TODO AI only for not 4x4 board
TODO add pruning
